               <P>Student Feedback system for College.
Here we have developed a faculty feedback system to NMSM Govt.College. The system is developed for keeping the good relationship between Teacher and their Students. Not for other ethical problems. which is generally used in the college to rate the faculty based on their performance...Here we have 3 modules such as administrator, student and faculty.
Students can register them using registration form in the website and creates their account to rate their teacher's perfomance.
Administrator is the one who creates the faculty account by adding all faculty information and assigning the username and password. 
Admin also checks the result once all students entered the feedback.

We can start the development from the login page, where we have given the option to login as admin and student and teacher...Here since we have only one admin account.

You can perform all admin actions such as login to the account and check result..

If you entered the student user and password and selected student option, then it will show all student information and let you enter the feedback based on the subject..
Each teacher can login using their unique id and password to view the feedbacks given by their students..
